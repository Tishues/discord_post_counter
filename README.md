## Post Counter

My <b>Discord Post Counter</b> is my first real world project!
It's a simple program but it is an idea that I knew I could bring to life, so I did!

It takes posts from discord and prints out relative information such as:
- Original poster
- All users that commented on the post
- Amount of posts per User
- Total posts amount
- Expected Boot.dev Discord karma from help threads

<i>Reasliticly, my <b>Post Counter</b> can be used on any forum/posts with some slight adjustments but it was first designed for discord specifically</i>

# Setup
- Create an empty .txt file in the "posts" folder and name it post.txt 
- (or adjust the path in main.py to match your file)
- Run:
```python3 main.py```
